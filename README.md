This code cannot be copied and pasted it needs to be edited to suit you. You also need a dotenv file but you can replace it with config.json. To download the files do npm install and then node index. Remember to do npm init to make your project.
### DOCS
Really all you need to do is add a file called`.env` nothing in front of it just `.env`. You won't find this file here cause it is in my `.gitignore`. You'd also need to add a config.json for your prefix,etc. You also need a db I have used mongodb so if you use sqlite of something else you'd need to edit my code a lot.
